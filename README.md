## 🧠 What I’m practicing

- Core Python fundamentals (syntax, variables, control flow)
- Data structures in depth (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets)
- Working with nested data structures and real-world data
- Functions, parameters, return values and basic error handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, composition)
- Organizing code using classes as modules
- File handling (reading/writing files, working with file paths)
- Writing clean, readable and maintainable Python code
- Applying concepts through exercises from *Python Crash Course* and *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*

## 📝 How I use this repository

- I write **daily notes** in `notes.md`
- I solve exercises to reinforce concepts
- When a topic is solid, I build a small **mini project**
- I commit regularly to track real progress

## 🎯 Goal

Build strong Python foundations and gradually move towards **AI Engineering**.
