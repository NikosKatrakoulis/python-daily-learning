# Using the list sandwich_orders from Exercise 7-8, make sure the sandwich
# 'pastrami' appears in the list at least three times. Add code near the
# beginning of your program to print a message saying the deli has run out
# of pastrami, and then use a while loop to remove all occurences of
# 'pastrami' from sandwich_orders. Make sure no pastrami sandwiches end
# up in finished_sandiches.
