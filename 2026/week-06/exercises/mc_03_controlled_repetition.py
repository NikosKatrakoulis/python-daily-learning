Mini-Challenge 3 — Controlled Repetition (Safe “Infinite Skills”)

Goal:
- Combine: repetition idea + safe stopping + clean output.

Instructions:
1) Create a file named mc_03_controlled_repetition.py.
2) Make the program print the SAME message 10 times.
   Message must be exactly:
   "I am building skills in Python!"
3) Run it and confirm it stops on its own after 10 prints.

Bonus:
4) Change the message to a custom one and run again.

Success criteria:
- The message appears 10 times and the program ends normally.
