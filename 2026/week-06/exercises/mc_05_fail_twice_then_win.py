Mini-Challenge 5 — Make It Fail Twice (Then Win)

Goal:
- Combine: debugging practice + attention to detail + final clean run.

Instructions:
1) Create a file named mc_05_fail_twice_then_win.py.
2) Write ONE correct print statement first (a simple greeting).
3) Add a second print statement but introduce a typo on purpose.
4) Run the file, read the error, and fix it.
5) Now introduce a DIFFERENT typo (in either line 1 or line 2).
6) Run, read the error, fix it again.
7) Final run: both lines should print correctly.

Success criteria:
- You experience two different errors and end with a clean 2-line output.
