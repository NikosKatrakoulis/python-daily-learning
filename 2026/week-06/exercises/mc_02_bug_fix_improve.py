Mini-Challenge 2 — Bug → Fix → Improve

Goal:
- Combine: reading an error, fixing it & extending the program.

Instructions:
1) Create a file named mc_02_bug_fix_improve.py.
2) Type this broken line exactly:

   print("I will get better at Python!)

3) Run it and read the error message.
4) Fix the line so it works.
5) Add TWO more print statements below it:
   - One line about what you practiced today
   - One line about what you want to learn next
6) Run the program again.

Success criteria:
- You intentionally hit an error, fixed it and end with 3
printed lines total.
"""

print("I will get better at Python!")
print("Today I practiced basically syntax, print phrases and fix syntax errors.")
print("I will learn tomorrow about the variables.")
