Exercise 3 — Infinite Skills (Personalized)

Goal:
- Practice "doing something endless" on purpose, then stopping it safely.

Instructions:
1) Create a file named ex_03_infinite_skills.py.
2) Write a program that prints a short message repeatedly (for example:
   "I am building skills in Python!")
3) Run it and observe what happens.

Important:
- Stop the program manually (usually with Ctrl+C in the terminal).

Bonus (still simple):
4) Change the message to something that motivates you personally.
5) Run it again, stop it again.

Success criteria:
- You successfully create an infinite loop-like behavior (repeated output)
  and you know how to stop it safely.
