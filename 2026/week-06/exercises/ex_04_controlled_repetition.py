Exercise 4 — Infinite Skills, But Controlled (Safe Upgrade)

Goal:
- Learn the simplest way to avoid a truly infinite run while keeping the same idea.

Instructions:
1) Create a file named ex_04_controlled_repetition.py.
2) Print the message "I am building skills in Python!" exactly 10 times.
   (Hint: use a loop, but keep it beginner-simple. If you haven't learned loops yet,
   try to do it manually for now — but come back later and replace it with a loop.)

Success criteria:
- The output repeats exactly 10 times and then the program ends normally.
