Exercise 1 — Hello World Typos (Personalized)

Goal:
- Practice typing a tiny Python program correctly and spotting simple typos.

Instructions:
1) Create a new file named ex_01_hello_world_typos.py.
2) Type the following line EXACTLY (do not copy/paste):
   print("Hello, Python world!")
3) Run the file and confirm you see the message in the terminal.

Now intentionally break it:
4) Make ONE small typo that causes an error (choose only one):
   - Remove a quote
   - Misspell print as prnit
   - Remove a parenthesis
5) Run the file again and read the error message carefully.
6) Fix the typo and run it one more time.

Success criteria:
- You can produce an error on purpose, understand where it points and fix it.
