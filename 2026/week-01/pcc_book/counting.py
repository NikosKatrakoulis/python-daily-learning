# You can use a while loop to count up through a series of
# numbers. For example, the following while loop counts from
# 1 to 5:

current_number = 1

while current_number <= 5:
    print(current_number)
    current_number += 1

# In the first line, we start counting from 1 by assigning
# current_number the value 1. The while loop is then set to keep
# running as long as the value of current_number is less than or
# equal to 5. The code inside the loop prints the value of
# current_number and then adds 1 to that value.
# Python repeats the loop as long as the condition
# current_number <= 5 is true. Because 1 is less than 5, Python
# prints 1 and then adds 1, making the current number 2.
# Because 2 is less than 5, Python prints 2 and adds 1 again,
# making the current number 3, and so on. Once the value of
# current_number is greater than 5, the loop stops running and
# the program ends.
