# The isX() string methods are helpful when you need to validate user
# input. For example, the following program repeatedly asks users for
# their age and a password until they provide valid input.

while True:
    print("\nEnter your age?")
    age = input()
    if age.isdecimal():
        break
    print("Please enter a number for your age.")

while True:
    print("\nSelect a new password (letters and numbers only)")
    password = input()
    if password.isalnum():
        break
    print("Passwords can only have letters and numbers.")

# In the first while loop, we ask the user for their age and store their
# input in age. If age is a valid (decimal) value, we break out of this first
# while loop and move on to the second, which asks for a password. Otherwise,
# we inform the user that they need to enter a number and again ask them to
# enter their age. In the second while loop, we ask for a password, store the
# user’s input in password, and break out of the loop if the input was alphanu
# meric. If it wasn’t, we’re not satisfied, so we tell the user the password
# needs to be alphanumeric and again ask them to enter a password. Calling
# isdecimal() and isalnum() on variables, we’re able to test whether
# the values stored in those variables are decimal or not and alphanumeric
# or not. Here, these tests help us reject the input forty two but accept 42,
# and reject secr3t! but accept secr3t.
