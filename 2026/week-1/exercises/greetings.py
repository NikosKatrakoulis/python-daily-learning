# Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1,
# but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them.
# The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be
# personalized with the person’s name.

names = ['meletis', 'thakis', 'giorgos', 'dimitris']
print(f"Hello {names[0].title()}, nice to see you. How are you doing?")
