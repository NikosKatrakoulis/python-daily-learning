# Create a Router class that contains a WiFiModule object.
# The WiFiModule should have an attribute speed (default 100 Mbps) and a method show_speed() that prints the current speed.

# Add a method upgrade_speed() that upgrades the speed to 300 Mbps if it’s not already.

# Create a router with default speed, show the speed, upgrade it, and show the speed again.
