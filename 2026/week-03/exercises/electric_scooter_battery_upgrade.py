# Create a Scooter class that contains a Battery object.
# The battery should have an attribute battery_size (default 30) and a method get_range() that prints range based on the battery size.

# Add a method upgrade_battery() that upgrades battery_size to 50 if it’s not already.

# Create a scooter with default battery, call get_range(), upgrade the battery, and call get_range() again to show increased range.
